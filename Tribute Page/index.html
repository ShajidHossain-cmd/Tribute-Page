                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p> John McCarthy was a computer scientist and pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) who is known for coining the term "artificial intelligence" and for his contributions to the development of programming languages and AI systems.</p>

                <h3>Early work:</h3>
                <p> McCarthy began exploring the concept of "thinking machines" in the 1950s and developed the programming language FORTRAN. He also contributed to the development of time-sharing systems, which allowed multiple users to access a computer simultaneously.</p>

            <section class="contributions to AI">
                <h3>Contributions to AI:</h3>
                <p>McCarthy advocated for the use of logic-based systems and developed the field of knowledge representation, which involved developing formal systems for representing and manipulating information. He also emphasized the importance of "common sense" reasoning in AI and worked to develop formal systems for representing this kind of knowledge.</p>

            <section class="later career">
                <h3>Later career:</h3>
                <p>  McCarthy continued to make important contributions to the development of programming languages for AI, including the logic-based language Prolog. He also continued to explore the philosophical and ethical implications of AI and advocated for responsible and ethical development of intelligent machines.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="legacy">
                <h3>Legacy:</h3>
                <p> McCarthy's legacy in computer science and AI is profound and enduring. His contributions to programming languages, knowledge representation, and logic-based systems continue to influence the field to this day. He also had a significant impact on the culture of the field, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations in the design of intelligent machines.</p>
